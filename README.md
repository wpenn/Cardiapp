# Cardiapp 

## Description
Built in the IOS/Apple environment, Cardiapp tracks heart rate data from consumer friendly monitors like the Apple Watch and FitBit; it gives advice to improve heart health and informs the user about irregularities, empowering and encouraging the user to take control of their heart health. We built the application using [Swift](https://swift.org/), [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [PHP](http://www.php.net/), and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).

## Cocoa Pods Used
* [Charts](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Charts)
* [JTAppleCalendar](https://cocoapods.org/pods/JTAppleCalendar)


### Note: This repository holds code for the Apple iPhone and Apple Watch application, which interacts with our SQL servers, but does not have the server-side code.
